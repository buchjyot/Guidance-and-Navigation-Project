Study of Schuller Oscillations 

# Abstract
An Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a self-contained navigation technique in which measurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the position, velocity and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point. Providing accurate initial conditions to the inertial navigator is one of the key challenge as any
errors in actual navigation state and computed navigation state accumulates over time. However, due to the curvature of the earth acting as a feedback, most errors do not
grow unboundedly but exhibits an oscillatory behavior which are referred to as Schuler Oscillations. This behavior is observed after ignoring the states which grow unboundedly
and removing their influence from the dynamics. The initial condition error behavior for INS has been studied and MATLAB simulation results are provided.
